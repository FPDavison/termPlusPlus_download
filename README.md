# term++
An improved file explorer and terminal rolled into one.

## How To Download

On Linux: Download term++, then chmod u+rwx term++ to give yourself permission
to run, read, and write to the program file. Then you can run it by simply
typing term++ in the same folder.

Currently, the compiled binary requires GLIBC_2.29 or greater (released Feb 2019).
Newer versions should be supported; older ones are not.


## Under Construction

Full modularisation, including support for custom behaviour for diverse filetypes,
and the abitity to define and save custom filetypes and behaviours on the fly.

Modular approach to panels, allowing the term++ interface itself to be user-customised
and allow add-ons like integrated web browsing and figure plotting.

## Key Features

### Adapted for Work

File explorers are laid out to do one thing: display a filesystem.
term++ goes beyond this, organising, viewing and searching by file type
and providing quick buttons for the most useful terminal commands for each filetype.

### Personalised and Personalisable

No need to dig into source code: everything term++ does can be customised to suit your workflow.
From selecting the filetypes you want to see, to tuning up what options you want available for each,
to changing the interface itself: term++ is built to be used by you, for what you want to use it for,
and how you want to use it.

### Persistent and Reliable

Coming back to a workflow after months or years means relearning idioms, arguments and processes
you've left behind. term++'s Projects feature allows you to set up a collection of all the files
a workflow needs, without needing to rearrange or duplicate anything. You can set up every figure for
a paper, every part of a data processing workflow, or every step in between, and come back to them
any time, with all your settings and arguments saved by term++.
